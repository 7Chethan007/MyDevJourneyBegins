In this module I basically learnt about the  
the Html standard syntax to be followed 
and how to link the css file written on another file
and how to link the font from the Google
IMP :-  Not the adding the font link form thte google 
        in head section of the html 
        but crutially changing the font-family name 
        to the font from google is to paid attention to.
